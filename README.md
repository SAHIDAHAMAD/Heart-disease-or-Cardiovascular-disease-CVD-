EDA , Extensive Analysis + Visualization with Python
ðŸš€ Heart Disease/CVD Analysis Using Python ðŸ«€

In this project, I performed Extensive Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization to explore and understand factors contributing to heart disease (Cardiovascular Disease). Using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, I analyzed various health indicators and demographics. The dataset was thoroughly cleaned and processed, followed by insightful correlation analysis and statistical visualizations such as heatmaps, scatter plots, and more. My goal was to uncover trends, patterns, and key factors impacting heart health. This project aims to provide a deeper understanding of CVD risk factors and aid in preventive measures.
